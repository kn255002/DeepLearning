Supervisor learning:	Analyze pic then (object detection, Image segmentation, guess action,guess mood  etc.)
						We provide input, Machine has rule and returns Output.
						
	Selfsupervised learning:	Herositic algorithm
	
UnSupervisor learning:	Cluster, Group
Reinforcement learning: Reward based learning, agent, action,










Vectorization:			Convert data into numbers/numpy/tensors
Feature Engineering:	Part wise engin
Universal workflow:		How to analyze data, then you design solution.


Overfitting: 	You can't win, you can not finish Overfitting 100. However, you can reduce overfitting.


Continuous:		Infinite values, value in fractions, we use Regression values. 
Discrete:		Its numbers, finite, Amnesit vlaues are discrete.

there are three type of data level:

1:
2:
3:

			
Holdout cross validation means: Divide data in to 3-parts [training:(trainin and validation), test]
'Training data' can be broken with 'K', for example K=4. Now you break data in to 4 pieces.

Now you run loop on HCV:
Accuracy(x1)= |val | Tr | Tr | Tr|
Accuracy(x2)= |val | Tr | Tr | Tr|
Accuracy(x3)= |val | Tr | Tr | Tr|
Accuracy(x4)= |val | Tr | Tr | Tr|

Avgerage(Accuracy(xi))
